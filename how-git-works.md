**Markdown** is a *text-to-HTML* conversion tool and it can be used on the **GitHub** platform. It will control the display of the text on the pages by converting the plain text formatting to HTML. You don't need to edit the **css** file to change the attribute of your text.

Markdown will help you transform the plain text to **bold**, *italic*, [adding links](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) or ![images](http://manchester.unh.edu/sites/default/themes/manchester/images/logo_outline.png).
**Markdown** is not only available on [GitHub.com](http://github.com). You can download it from [daringfireball]http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/); however, **Markdown** also requires the standard Perl library module.
